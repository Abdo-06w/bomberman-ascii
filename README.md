# Bomberman ASCII

BomberMan ASCII is a terminal-based game written in C++ inspired by the classic Bomberman.
The game uses ASCII graphics and features 5 interconnected levels, enemies, bomb mechanics, power-ups, a scoring system, and a global timer, all playable directly in the terminal.

Design choice:
  The project intentionally avoids STL containers to practice low-level memory management and manual game loop handling.
